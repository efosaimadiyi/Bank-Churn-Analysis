### Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a bank within the financial services industry. Churn, where customers close accounts and leave, is a critical issue that impacts revenue and growth. By exploring demographic and behavioral patterns, this analysis aims to help the bank retain customers and stay competitive in a crowded market, making it vital for business sustainability.

### Problem Statement
The bank is losing customers at an alarming rate, raising the question: 
- "Why are some customers ghosting us?"
  
  This project addresses this business challenge by answering key questions:
  
- Who are the churned customers (age, gender, geography, card types)?
- Is churn linked to satisfaction, complaints, or product engagement?
- Does tenure, credit card usage, or salary affect loyalty?
  
  The goal is to uncover patterns and propose solutions to reduce churn and improve retention.
