### Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a bank within the financial services industry. Churn, where customers close accounts and leave, is a critical issue that impacts revenue and growth. By exploring demographic and behavioral patterns, this analysis aims to help the bank retain customers and stay competitive in a crowded market, making it vital for business sustainability.

### Problem Statement
The bank is losing customers at an alarming rate, raising the question: 
- "Why are some customers ghosting us?"
  
  This project addresses this business challenge by answering key questions:
  
- Who are the churned customers (age, gender, geography, card types)?
- Is churn linked to satisfaction, complaints, or product engagement?
- Does tenure, credit card usage, or salary affect loyalty?
  
  The goal is to uncover patterns and propose solutions to reduce churn and improve retention.

### Data Overview
The dataset, sourced from an online data analysis community, includes 10,000 customer records. Limitations include some misspelled names, duplicates,  which may affect data quality, but the core metrics remain reliable for analysis.

### Methodologies
Step 1: Data cleaning and transformation

Tools: Power Query (Power Bi)
- Removed duplicates
- Grouped age range into Gen z(18-28), Millennials(29-44), Gen X(45-60), Baby Boomers(61-79), and Silent generation(80-92).

Step 2: Analysis and Dashboard Creation

Tools : Power point and Power Bi visualizaion features
- Created a wireframe using Power Bi
- Built interactive dashboards with filters
- Used bar charts, column charts, scatter charts, donut chart, and map to visualize key churn trends.

### Insights
- Customers aged 45-60 are leaving at a much higher rate.
- More than half of the customers who left are female.
- Germany has a noticeably higher rate of customers leaving compared to Spain and France.
- Customers who left have slightly higher average balances than those who stay, showing money alone doesnâ€™t keep them.
- Lower satisfaction scores, especially below average, are linked to more customers leaving.
- Almost all customers who left had complaints, while very few who stay did, indicating a big service issue.
- The number of products a customer has affects churn, with 100% of customers using all four of the product leaving.
- Customers tend to stay longer as their time with the bank increases, suggesting loyalty builds over time.
